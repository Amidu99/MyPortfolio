            Monkeys are clever, social animals. They are known for running and leaping through trees with ease.
            Like apes and humans, monkeys belong to the group of mammals called primates.
            Monkeys look somewhat like apes such as chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas.
            But monkeys differ from apes in several ways. For instance, every monkey has a tail,
            even if it is just a tiny nub. Apes do not have tails. Monkeys also generally have narrower chests
            than apes do. There are about 200 species, or types, of monkey. Scientists divide them into two groups,
            Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Old World monkeys include baboons, drills,
            mandrills, macaques, guenons, languors, and colobus monkeys. Among the
            New World monkeys are marmosets, tamarinds, howler monkeys, spider monkeys,
            squirrel monkeys, woolly monkeys, and cappuccino.
        </p>

            Old World monkeys are found in Africa and parts of Asia. New World monkeys are found in the tropical
            regions of Central and South America. Most monkeys live mainly in trees in rainforests.
            Baboons and some other kinds live mostly on the ground in grasslands or rocky areas.
            Monkeys vary greatly in size. The pygmy marmoset is only about 6 inches (14 centimeters) long,
            not including the tail. The largest baboons may grow to 45 inches (115 centimeters) in length.
            On the whole, Old World monkeys are larger than New World monkeys. Old World monkeys also have narrower
            noses than New World monkeys do. New World monkeys usually have long tails. Some kinds even use their
            tails to hold onto branches. By contrast, some Old World monkeys have only short stubs for tails.

            Monkeys use all four limbs—two arms and two legs—to walk and run. Their hands and feet are good for
            grasping tree branches. Monkeys have a coat of hair on most of their bodies. Many types have bare
            areas of skin on the face and buttocks. Male mandrills and some other types have brightly colored
            skin in these bare areas. Most monkeys have fairly flat faces. However, baboons and mandrills have
            doglike faces, with snouts that stick out.
            Most monkey species are active mostly during the day. The owl monkeys are active at night.
            They are also called night monkeys. Monkeys are intelligent animals that are good at solving problems.
            Almost all types live together in groups. A monkey group commonly includes several related females,
            their young, and one or more males. Monkeys use facial expressions, body movements, and various noises
            to communicate with each other. For example, squirrel monkeys have more than 25 different calls.
            These calls can sound like barks, purrs, screams, peeps, and squawks. The deep howls of howler
            monkeys can be heard from 2 to 3 miles (3 to 5 kilometers) away.
            Most monkeys eat mainly plants. Different types eat fruits, flowers, seeds, shoots, roots, and leaves.
            Some types of monkey also eat birds’ eggs, insects, and other small animals.

            The period of pregnancy in monkeys ranges from about five months to more than seven months.
            In most species the female usually has one baby at a time. The babies are born helpless.
            Monkeys depend heavily on their parents for care during their early life.
            In most types the young monkeys become adults at about 3 to 4 years of age.
            Many types of monkey are endangered, or at risk of dying out completely. People have cut down
            the trees in large parts of the rainforests where monkeys live. People also hunt
            monkeys for their meat and fur. In addition, some monkeys are captured and sold as pets.
